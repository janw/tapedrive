        Hi! Nice to see you here. It means that you probably like podcasts and hoarding data. Unfortunately your podcast list is currently empty. How about adding some of your favorite feeds?

      Tape Drive supports adding single feed URLs and OPML files that you have exported from another podcast client. If you have nothing at hand right now, that's okay, too. We have some suggestions for you as well.
